When I need a software but I can't find one really suitable, choose one which is pretty close to my needs, then fork it and modify it. Well, if none of them are even close, I will build it from scratch.

- ### [Tabman](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/telescope-tabman.nvim) - a telescope.nvim plugin

  If you use Neovim as an IDE, and mainly use telescope.nvim as a file picker, then you may find my plugin to be the long wanted missing tabpages picker.

- ### [link-finder](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/link-finder) - a Chrome extension that can help you capture web traffic urls

  Normally, you use the Chrome DevTool to monitor network traffic. But some website may stop running when the DevTool is opened, so I write a chrome extension to query the chorme API for all network traffic, avoiding the DevTool altogether. 

- ### [waylandmap](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/waylandmap) - a key mapping app for Linux that works under X11 or Wayland
  ![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-white?logo=python) ![pypi](https://img.shields.io/badge/pypi-white?logo=pypi) ![linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/linux-white?logo=linux)

  This project is distributed as [waylandmap](https://pypi.org/project/waylandmap/) on PyPI.org. The best use case I found for myself is to map \`RightAlt\` + \`hjkl\` to be the arrow keys by making \`RightAlt\` to be a 3rd-level shift key.

- ### [opensubtitles-dl](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/opensubtitles-dl) - you can search opensubtitle.org directly in the terminal
  ![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-white?logo=python) ![pypi](https://img.shields.io/badge/pypi-white?logo=pypi)

  This project is distributed as [opensubtitles-dl](https://pypi.org/project/opensubtitles-dl/) on PyPI.org.

- ### [wide-lihkg-userscript](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/wide-lihkg-userscript) - sideload custom CSS into lihkg

  ![javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-white?logo=javascript) ![css](https://img.shields.io/badge/css-white?logo=css3&logoColor=blue)

  This project is distributed as [Wide LIHKG](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/430707-wide-lihkg) on greasyfork.org.
