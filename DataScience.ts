  `## Data Science

I have done some data science and machine learning research projects in the past. Some interesting project are listed here as well.

- ### [toy-openai-gym-collections](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/toy-openai-gym-collections) - all about  deep reinforcement learning

  ![openai](https://img.shields.io/badge/openai-white?logo=openai&logoColor=black)
  ![numpy](https://img.shields.io/badge/numpy-white?logo=numpy&logoColor=blue)

  Try to use use deep reinforcement learning models to play computer games! It was not easy at all.

- ### [toy-datasets-collections](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/toy-datasets-collections)

  ![tensorflow](https://img.shields.io/badge/tensorflow-white?logo=tensorflow)
  ![keras](https://img.shields.io/badge/keras-white?logo=keras&logoColor=red)
  ![pytorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/pytorch-white?logo=pytorch)
  ![scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-white?logo=scikit-learn)

  These are very common machine learning and deep learning datasets.

- ### [marble-drawing-scam-analysis](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/marble-drawing-scam-analysis)

  ![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-white?logo=python)
  ![jupyter](https://img.shields.io/badge/jupyter-white?logo=jupyter)
  ![pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/pandas-white?logo=pandas&logoColor=darkblue)

  To solve any probability problems, you can either use maths to solve it by first principal, or use programming to solve it by simulation.
