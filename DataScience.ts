  `## Data Science

I have done some data science and machine learning research projects in the past. Some interesting project are listed here as well.

- ### [toy-openai-gym-collections](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/toy-openai-gym-collections) - all about  deep reinforcement learning

  Try to use use deep reinforcement learning models to play computer games! It was not easy at all.

  ![tensorflow](https://img.shields.io/badge/tensorflow-white?logo=tensorflow) ![keras](https://img.shields.io/badge/keras-white?logo=keras&logoColor=red) ![pytorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/pytorch-white?logo=pytorch) ![scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-white?logo=scikit-learn)

  These are very common machine learning and deep learning datasets.
