I write code to research the financial market all the time.

- ### [hong-kong-interbank-liquidity-plot](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/hong-kong-interbank-liquidity-plot)
  Do you think the USD-HKD peg is gonna hold? Here is an indicator you need to pay attention to.

- ### [terra-luna-ust-revival-analysis-May-2022](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/terra-luna-ust-revival-analysis-May-2022)
  A valuation model for Terra 2.0 before the launch of the new LUNA token.

- ### [impermanent-loss-simulation](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/impermanent-loss-simulation)

  When you provide liquidity to a liquidity pool to earn fees and incentives, you capital will face impermanent loss, but by how much? Here is a simulation.

- ### [automatic-market-maker-simulation](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/automatic-market-maker-simulation)

  How does a DEX like Uniswap works? It is built on automaatic market makers, which is very different from the traditional stock market. This jupyter notebook simulates the Constant Product Invariant Curve to better understand how it works.

- ### [marble-drawing-scam-analysis](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/marble-drawing-scam-analysis)

  To solve any probability problems, you can either use maths to solve it by first principal, or use programming to solve it by simulation.
