  `## Web Dev

Web dev is easy but also can be difficult. It is easy when you have a boilerplate to start with, but can be difficult when you need to build everything from scratch. I have built some starter projects, while trying to include some most common web dev technologies into them.

- ### [Quotes](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/quotes.quantumsnowball) - a beautiful mobile-friendly react app, fetching famous quotes by celebrities

  This project has been built and hosting at [quotes.quantumsnowball.ml](https://quotes.quantumsnowball.ml/). It is mobile-friendly, can be installed as a PWA using mobile Chrome browser.

- ### [Todos](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/todos-domain) - a todos app built using the MERN stack

  This project is still under development. When finished, it should be a ready-to-use boilerplate for a starter login app using the MERN stack.

- ### [js_todo_list_app](https://github.com/quantumsnowball/js_todo_list_app) - a pure javascript todos starter

  Sometimes you just want to code something using pure js, just to learn the basics.
